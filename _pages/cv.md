SUMMARY
=======
I have gained 5 years of extensive research experience in optical remote sensing and its principles, geospatial image processing, machine learning techniques, and radiometric and photometric measurement techniques for water color remote sensing. My doctoral degree in optical remote sensing is expected to be completed in July 2025. My focus is on analyzing various optical satellite sensors data and developing advanced algorithms for regional and global oceanic waters.

RESEARCH EXPERTISE
==================
* Knowledge in scientific concepts and technical aspects of in-situ photometry, radiometry and optical
remote sensing.
* Interpretation of water-leaving radiance / remote sensing reflectance of different aquatic environments
(including different algal blooms, sediment plumes, and CDOM-rich waters).
* Proficient in handling the photometric (AC-S, BB9, LISST-VSF, FLNTU, and CTD) and radiometric
instruments (RAMSES TriOS).
* Experience in sensor calibration of the photometric and radiometric instruments.
* Proficient in laboratory measurements and analysis of optical parameters (Chlorophyll-a, Suspended
Sediments, and CDOM).

FIELD EXPERIENCE
*  Participated in scientific cruise and field programs carried out during 2019-2024:
*  Inland waters: Muttukad lagoon (Turbid-Productive waters), Muthupettai lagoon (Turbid waters), and
Edaikazhinadu backwaters (Productive waters).
*  Coastal waters: Chennai, Muthupettai, and Tharangambadi coasts along the coast of Tamilnadu, India.
*  Open oceanic waters: Off West coast of India, Central Arabian Sea on the oceanographic research
vessel Sagar Tara.
*  Participated in a field campaign aimed at understanding the influence of the bubble clouds on the remote
sensing reflectance and the water colour products (February 2020).
*  Participated in a field program aimed at detecting macro-plastics using In-situ radiometric measurements
and UAV-based hyperspectral remote sensing data (April 2023).
*  Participated in a field program focused on the assessment and monitoring of the coral reefs in the Gulf of
Mannar, India using In-situ and remote sensing data (June 2023).
*  Participated in a field campaign focused on oil spill mapping and characterization using UAV-based
hyperspectral remote sensing (December 2023).
*  Participated in a field program in the Kochi backwaters region, Kerala, with the objective of identifying algae
species and detecting them using UAV-based hyperspectral remote sensing data (February 2024).

TECHICAL SKILLS
*  Programming: Python, MATLAB, and C++.
*  Applications and tools: SeaDAS, SNAP, and Hydrolight.
*  Geospatial softwares: ArcGIS, QGIS, ENVI, and ERDAS.
*  Experience in Linux and Windows platforms, and High-Performance Computing Environment (HPCE).
*  Experience in writing detailed project proposals for various research initiatives, securing funding and
approval from government funding agencies and research institutions.
